# CLAUDE-EDIT 2026-06-17: added while root-causing the Windows-only
# test_ask_purpose_question_routes_to_role_view AttributeError (full
# incident in REFACTOR OPS BOARD.md 2026-06-17 "algebra shape contract"
# entry). The root issue wasn't a bug in the AI compiler - Select(ROLE,
# metric="files") for a question naming one specific file is a legitimate,
# arguably more precise choice than the full view, and the registry
# validates it as such. The bug was that a consumer assumed only one
# shape (the full view object) could ever come back.
#
# QueryResult.data's shape is fully determined by QueryResult.metric:
#   metric is None    -> data is the full view (a views.py dataclass,
#                         or a dict for any future dict-shaped view)
#   metric == "X"      -> data IS the projected value of field X already
#                         (a list, dict, int, str - whatever that field's
#                         type is), not an object containing field X.
#
# Any code reading a QueryResult's payload - tests, Assessor.ask()
# callers, a future narration layer - should go through get_field()
# instead of assuming a fixed shape derived from intent/view labels.
# Works uniformly across dataclass-shaped views (attribute access) and
# any dict-shaped view (key access).
