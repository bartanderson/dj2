# used to be unconditionally [] with the comment "no DB comparison
# anymore." Investigated whether engine/structural_parity_diff.py's
# run_structural_diff() (the historical engine-vs-DB parity check this
# name likely meant) could be revived - it can't: it requires an
# in-memory file_analyses object Assessor's DB-only architecture never
# produces, and it has zero callers anywhere (confirmed via grep), so
# wiring it would mean inventing fake engine-side data just to fill the
# field - exactly what "never invent information" rules out. What's real
# instead: Assessor.run_integrity_check() already compares two
# independently-persisted tables that are supposed to agree
# (graph_edges vs symbol_references) and flags edge_count_mismatch when
# they don't - a genuine DB-internal mismatch, just never wired into the
# Truth Layer. See Assessor.db_mismatches() for the extraction. Default
# kept as [] so existing callers that don't pass anything keep exactly
# the prior behavior.
