# tools/analysis/agent/claude_eval.py
#
# Claude's non-interactive access path to the agent pipeline.
# Simulates what Bart does in the REPL, driven by Claude's own judgment.
# Bart directs the work; Claude runs this, evaluates outputs, writes
# human-confirmed corrections to knowledge.db.
#
# Usage:
#   python tools/analysis/agent/claude_eval.py world_corpus.db ask "how does encounter work?"
#   python tools/analysis/agent/claude_eval.py world_corpus.db batch questions.txt
#   python tools/analysis/agent/claude_eval.py world_corpus.db auto --mode unknown --limit 5
#   python tools/analysis/agent/claude_eval.py world_corpus.db store adjudication_engine.py file_purpose "Central game action router..."
#   python tools/analysis/agent/claude_eval.py world_corpus.db store --workflow backlog "add crafting" "Implement crafting system"
