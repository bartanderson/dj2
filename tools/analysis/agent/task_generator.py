# tools/analysis/agent/task_generator.py
#
# Generates task.md - a plain Markdown checklist of everything that may need
# review when a given symbol changes.
#
# Two-tier result model (see TRACKER.md item 6 audit, 2026-06-19):
#   Tier 1 - "Direct callers (confirmed)": graph_edges WHERE callee = symbol.
#             These are the exact files/lines that call the symbol directly.
#   Tier 2 - "Impact zone (may need review)": route_query() with seeds=[symbol]
#             override. This is the reverse-closure neighborhood from that
#             specific symbol, not a token-match superset.
#
# The generator writes task.md to a path chosen by the caller, or returns the
# content as a string if no path is given.
