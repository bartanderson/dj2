tools.analysis.contracts

This package defines the authoritative structural contract system
for the analysis pipeline.

It includes:

- AST ingestion contracts
- SymbolIdentity semantic identity contracts
- classification contracts
- snapshot contracts
- validation contracts

It must NOT contain:
- runtime execution logic
- graph mutation logic
- routing logic
- identity reconstruction algorithms (SymbolIdentity lives outside contracts)

CONTRACT LAYERS:
- AST (observation)
- SymbolIdentity (semantic identity reconstruction)
- classification (deterministic routing)
- snapshot (aggregation)
- metrics (global reduction)
