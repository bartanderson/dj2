# CLAUDE-EDIT 2026-06-16: the real, wired entrypoint.
#
# The 2026-06-16 agent-readiness assessment (see docs/REFACTOR OPS BOARD.md)
# found that QuerySession.run_algebra() — the one method that chains
# real NL -> oracle router -> AI compiler -> AST -> executor -> real Truth
# Layer views — had ZERO callers anywhere in the codebase. It had never
# been run end-to-end against a live project DB. This script is that
# caller. It is the "front door": agent asks a question, Truth Layer
# answers it, against a real DB, with no stub data anywhere in the path.
#
# It supersedes oracle/agent.py and oracle/nl_agent.py, which looked like
# "the agent" but bypassed oracle_router / QuerySession / the Truth Layer
# entirely (raw LLM-extracted intent dict -> direct oracle call, no AST,
# no validation, no determinism guarantee). Those two files have been
# deleted; this is what replaced them.
#
# Usage:
#     python tools/analysis/ask.py <db_path> "<question>"
#
# Example:
#     python tools/analysis/ask.py C_Users_bartl_dev_dj2_tools_analysis.db \
#         "what depends on resolve_analysis_db_path"
#
# What it does, concretely:
#     oracle = DBOracle(db_path)
#     assessor = Assessor(oracle)
#     result = assessor.ask(question)
#         -> session().run_algebra(question, views=all_views())
#         -> all_views() builds STRUCTURE/STABILITY/INTEGRITY/SUMMARY/
#            SUBSYSTEM from real DB-backed data (assessor.py), all 5 —
#            none of them are stub objects.
#
# `result` contains both the oracle-router trace (intent, seeds,
# expansion) and the Truth Layer algebra result (the actual Select/
# Combine projection over the real views).
