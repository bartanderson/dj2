#
# TRACKER.md item 23: dead runtime_bindings wiring.
#
# scan_project_files.py passes a permanent `runtime_bindings = {}`
# placeholder into parse_ast(), and parse_ast() set FileAnalysis.runtime_bindings
# directly from that parameter - even though _extract_symbol_references()
# (called from inside the same parse_ast()) already computes the real,
# tree-derived bindings via _extract_runtime_bindings() for its OWN
# internal use, then discards them. The result: classify_references()'s
# production routing call - route_symbol(name=ref.callee,
# runtime_bindings=analysis.runtime_bindings, ...) - always received an
# empty dict, so the "runtime" bucket could never be assigned in
# production, no matter what the source actually contained.
#
# The existing unit test (test_symbol_classification_runtime_contract.py)
# never caught this because it builds its fixtures by calling
# _extract_runtime_bindings() directly and feeding the result straight
# into ProjectGraphContext/route_symbol - it never goes through
# FileAnalysis.runtime_bindings or scan_project_files()/parse_ast() at
# all, so it was structurally incapable of noticing the wiring gap.
#
# This test goes through the REAL pipeline entrypoints
# (parse_ast() -> classify_references()) - the same two calls
# analyze_files()/scan_project_files() chain together in production -
# against a fixture with a real runtime attribute-chain binding
# (`ai = engine.ai_system`), and proves the resulting SymbolReference
# is classified bucket="runtime" end-to-end, not via direct-fixture
# construction.
