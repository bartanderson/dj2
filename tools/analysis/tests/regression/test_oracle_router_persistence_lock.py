# tools/analysis/tests/regression/test_oracle_router_persistence_lock.py
#
# Locks in the "close the small holes" fixes (2026-06-16):
#   1. Builtin exclusion during graph expansion is decided by the DB's
#      own bucket classification (DBOracle.builtin_symbols()), not a
#      hardcoded word list in api/oracle_router.py.
#   2. Accessor-chain noise filtering (oracle/symbol_noise.py) still
#      works after being extracted out of db_oracle.py.
#   3. The dead _apply_intent_weights() stub does not exist.
#   4. QuerySession.run_query() durably persists every result to the
#      query_sessions table, not just the in-memory _history list.
#   5. A persistence failure never breaks the query contract — run_query()
#      still returns a valid result even if the DB write fails.
#
# Uses a real temp sqlite DB built through the real schema (ensure_schema),
# no mocking of the DB layer — only test 6 mocks the persistence call
# itself, since that's the one thing we WANT to fail on purpose.
