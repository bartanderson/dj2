#
# TRACKER.md item 22: embedding-fallback crash risk in seed discovery.
#
# discover_seed_symbols_semantic() previously only guarded the top-level
# `import numpy` / `from ...embedding_model import embed_text` statements
# with `except ImportError`. Any failure *after* that point - the actual
# model load inside embedding_model.get_model() (SentenceTransformer(...)),
# which can fail at call time due to a missing model cache, no network
# access, a corrupted download, etc. - propagated uncaught, all the way
# up through _discover_combined() -> discover_seed_symbols() ->
# oracle_router.route_query() -> QuerySession.run_query(), crashing every
# ask.py query whenever the model can't load, even though a perfectly
# good token-based fallback already exists in this same class.
#
# This file locks in the fix: discover_seed_symbols_semantic() must catch
# ANY exception raised while building/using the embedding index (not just
# ImportError) and fall back to _discover_token() - directly, not via
# discover_seed_symbols(), since that path re-enters
# discover_seed_symbols_semantic() through _discover_combined() and would
# recurse forever against a failure that won't go away on retry.
