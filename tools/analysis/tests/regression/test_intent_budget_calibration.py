# tools/analysis/tests/regression/test_intent_budget_calibration.py
#
# Locks in the 2026-06-17 Track A calibration pass to api/oracle_router.py's
# intent_budget table (see CLAUDE-EDIT 2026-06-17 comment at the call site):
#
#   1. reverse_query ("what uses X" / "used by") is a DIRECT-usage question
#      and must stop at 1 reverse hop - it must NOT reach the same 2-hop
#      transitive node that impact_query ("what depends on X") reaches.
#      Before this fix the two intents had identical reverse_depth=2
#      budgets, making them structurally indistinguishable.
#   2. surface_query ("what does X do" / "surface") must reach a 2-hop
#      forward node, not just direct callees - "structural zones" (plural)
#      requires more than a single hop.
#   3. impact_query and general_query are unchanged (reverse-only depth 2,
#      and balanced depth 1/1 respectively) - tests here also pin those so
#      a future change can't silently drift them.
#   4. The dead "two_hop" key (never read anywhere in _route_expand) is
#      gone from every intent_budget entry.
#
# Uses a fake graph object (plain object with a `.edges` list of objects
# exposing .caller/.callee) rather than a real DB - _route_expand only
# ever reads graph.edges, so this is a faithful, fast unit test of the
# traversal budgets themselves, independent of DB/discovery concerns
# already covered by test_oracle_router_persistence_lock.py.
