#
# CLAUDE-EDIT 2026-06-17: new regression suite closing out the "full
# mapping" audit Bart asked for after the Windows-only
# test_ask_purpose_question_routes_to_role_view AttributeError (see
# REFACTOR OPS BOARD.md 2026-06-17 "algebra shape contract" entry).
#
# That bug happened because a single consumer assumed QueryResult.data
# always had one fixed shape. The real contract is:
#   metric is None  -> data is the full view object (attribute access)
#   metric == "X"   -> data IS the value of field X already (no wrapper)
# get_field() (query_executor.py) is the shared accessor meant to make
# that contract impossible to get wrong from now on. This suite is the
# permanent proof that:
#   1. get_field() agrees with direct metric-selection, for every single
#      (view, metric) pair in the real registry - not just ROLE, all 6
#      views and all ~15 metrics, against real DB-backed data, not stubs.
#   2. get_field() returns the documented default (not a wrong value, not
#      a crash) when asked for a field that a *different* metric selection
#      legitimately doesn't carry.
#   3. SUBSYSTEM's full-view (metric=None) shape is attribute-accessible
#      like every other view, locking in the SubsystemView dataclass fix
#      (views.py / subsystem_view.py CLAUDE-EDIT 2026-06-17) so this
#      specific inconsistency can't quietly come back as a bare dict.
#   4. The AI-compiler prompt spec (_ALGEBRA_SPEC) can never silently
#      drift out of sync with the registry it's generated from, because
#      it's generated from QueryPlan.VALID_METRICS /
#      QuerySemanticsRegistry.VALID_COMBINES directly rather than
#      hand-duplicated text (query_compiler.py CLAUDE-EDIT 2026-06-17).
#
# Same fixture pattern as test_run_algebra_end_to_end.py / test_role_view
# _routing.py - real temp sqlite DB, real schema, no mocking of the DB
# layer.
