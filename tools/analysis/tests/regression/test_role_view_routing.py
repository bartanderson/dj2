# tools/analysis/tests/regression/test_role_view_routing.py
#
# Locks in the 2026-06-16/17 ROLE view fix (Truth.md Phase 3 Row 1 / Row 2:
# "purpose of a file" / "why does X exist" / "role of X" questions had no
# path to an answer - they fell through to general_query and got a
# content-blind STABILITY+INTEGRITY diagnostic regardless of which file
# was asked about, even though Assessor.responsibility_map() already had
# real, DB-backed, per-file role classification with no caller wiring it
# into the query algebra).
#
# This test is the permanent proof that:
#   1. ROLE is a 6th real Truth Layer view, buildable from real DB-backed
#      data via Assessor.all_views() (not a stub).
#   2. Select("ROLE") executes against that real data via QueryExecutor.
#   3. _detect_intent() actually classifies purpose/why/role phrasing as
#      role_query (this is the part that silently regressed once already
#      this session via a stale .pyc cache surviving a source edit - see
#      REFACTOR OPS BOARD.md 2026-06-17 note - so this test pins behavior
#      at the _detect_intent level too, not just at the ask() level).
#   4. Assessor.ask() routes those questions end-to-end to the ROLE view
#      and returns the real per-file role data, not a Combine of unrelated
#      views.
#
# Same fixture pattern as test_run_algebra_end_to_end.py - real temp
# sqlite DB, real schema, no mocking of the DB layer.
