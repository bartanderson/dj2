# tools/analysis/tests/regression/test_single_file_filter_scoping.py
#
# Locks in the 2026-06-17 single-named-file ROLE scoping fix (the bug Bart
# hit directly on his Windows machine: "what is the purpose of
# db_probe_toolsold.py" came back with the FULL unfiltered ROLE view - every
# file in the project - instead of just the one file named in the question).
#
# Root cause had three independent layers, all fixed together:
#   1. truth/query_ast.py's Filter and truth/query_executor.py's
#      _apply_filter were both fully implemented and already passing
#      planner-validation tests, but NOTHING upstream (neither the Ollama
#      prompt spec nor the rule-based fallback table in query_compiler.py)
#      ever constructed a Filter. Select.filter was None end-to-end. Same
#      "orphaned primitive" shape as the 2026-06-17 drift_signals fix.
#   2. QueryExecutor._select() applied Filter to the bare view object
#      BEFORE metric projection. Every real view is a dataclass, not a
#      dict/list, so _apply_filter's isinstance checks always fell through
#      to "return data unchanged" - even a correctly-constructed Filter
#      would have silently done nothing. Fixed by filtering AFTER
#      projection, against the actual projected list (ROLE's "files").
#   3. QuerySemanticsRegistry.VALID_FILTER_KEYS had no "ROLE" entry at all -
#      a Filter on ROLE would have been rejected by
#      QueryPlanner._validate_select() even if one had ever been built.
#
# The actual fix (query_compiler.py's _extract_single_file_filter() /
# _maybe_scope_to_named_file()) is deterministic regex + a planner-
# revalidated Filter, not an AI-compiler responsibility - the buggy run
# that surfaced this went through Ollama and still produced metric=None
# despite the prompt explicitly preferring metric="files" for one-named-
# file questions, proving prompt compliance isn't guaranteed even at
# temperature 0.0.
#
# Same fixture pattern as test_role_view_routing.py / test_run_algebra_
# end_to_end.py - real temp sqlite DB, real schema, no mocking of the DB
# layer.
